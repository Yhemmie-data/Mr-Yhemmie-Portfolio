## Customers Target Recommendation
Based on the comprehensive analysis of customer demographics and purchasing behavior among Amiable Ltd.’s 1000-strong customer base, the following recommendation is proposed for targeting the audience effectively

•	Targeted Marketing for Peak Age Groups: Amiable Ltd should focus its targeted marketing efforts on the middle-aged demographic, specifically individuals in the age group of 35 to 55 years. This age range has demonstrated a consistent and substantial presence in used car purchases over the past three years, with a notable peak observed in the 1975 - 1979 age group. Crafting marketing strategies that resonate with the preferences and needs of this age demographic, such as reliability, affordability, and features appealing to individuals in their mid-40s to early 50s, will likely yield optimal results.
•	Product/Service Development for Middle-Aged and Older Segments: The age group analysis also identified substantial purchase activity in age groups surrounding the peak, such as 1960 - 1969 and 1980 - 1984. Developing products or services tailored to the preferences and needs of middle-aged and older customer segments can capitalize on the broader customer base across different age demographics. This recommendation aligns with the observed positive trend in purchases concentrated in these segments.
•	Marketing Campaigns Reflecting Mass, Affluent, and High Net Worth Customer Preferences: The analysis of purchases by wealth index revealed that the majority of used car purchases are made by Mass Customers. Tailoring marketing campaigns to reflect the preferences and aspirations of Mass, Affluent, and High Net Worth customers can enhance the effectiveness of communication strategies. Understanding the unique characteristics and expectations of each wealth index category is crucial for creating targeted and resonant messaging.
•	Tailored Promotions for Sectors with Higher Purchasing Power: The analysis of purchases by job category highlighted sectors with significant interest in used car purchases, such as Financial Services and Manufacturing. Tailoring promotions and incentives for customers in these sectors acknowledges their higher purchasing power and can encourage further engagement. By recognizing and addressing the specific needs and preferences of these sectors, Amiable Ltd can enhance customer loyalty and market share.
•	Focus on Strengthening Market Presence in Southwest and North Regions: The regional analysis indicated that the Southwest region dominates in terms of car purchases, contributing 51% of the total. The North region also plays a significant role with 27% of the total purchases. Focusing on strengthening market presence in these regions aligns with the observed market trends and provides an opportunity for Amiable Ltd to consolidate its position in areas with higher purchasing activity. This strategy acknowledges the regional disparities and directs resources effectively.
